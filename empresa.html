        It began as a little sleeper project—a handy tool to update Counter-Strike—and morphed pretty quickly into the world's largest online gaming platform.<br>
        Steam guarantees instant access to more than 1,800 game titles and connects its 35 million active users to each other—and to us.<br>
        Through Steam, fans can easily buy, play, share, modify, and build communities around Valve products as well as titles from other independent game studios.<br>
        Steam is available in 237 countries and 21 different languages.
