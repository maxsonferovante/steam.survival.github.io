        It began as a little sleeper project—a handy tool to update Counter-Strike—and morphed pretty quickly into the world's largest online gaming platform.
        Steam guarantees instant access to more than 1,800 game titles and connects its 35 million active users to each other—and to us.
        Through Steam, fans can easily buy, play, share, modify, and build communities around Valve products as well as titles from other independent game studios.
        Steam is available in 237 countries and 21 different languages.
